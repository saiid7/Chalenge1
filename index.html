                <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
                   conforms to the ECMAAcript specification. JavaScript is high level,
                   often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.

            <div class="answer">
                <p>HTML and CSS are partners that work together to create web pages.
                   and while they might be team mates, HTML and CSS visually look
                   different, and they function differently too. so while you'll have
                   to learn both, it's easy to learn HTML and CSS together at the same 
                   time. They aren't hard.
